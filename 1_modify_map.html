    Assignment 1: Modify a leaflet web map
    In this assignment you will start with a working web map, and then modify and add to it.

    Task:

    1. Replace the tile layer with a different one.
    hint: use the Leaflet Providers page to find one: https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/
    2. Add new markers to the map at three of your favorite locations around Duluth.
    - Each marker should have a popup that includes the name of the location and a fun fact about it.
    - At least one of the markers should have an image or video in the popup.
    - You can remove the existing marker for the UMD campus if you want.
    3. Center the map on Duluth (change the zoom level as well if you want).
    4. Modify the title and subtitle to reflect your name and the theme of your map.
    5. Add a paragraph to the paragraph describing your map and the locations you added.
    6. Modify the style of each of the elements (header, paragraph, and map) to your liking.
    - At a minimum, remove the inline style on the map div and add your own CSS to the style tag in the head of the document.

    AI use: you can ask questions of AI (such as "explain what this line of code does" or "how do I create a popup in Leaflet?") 
    But try and write the code yourself.
