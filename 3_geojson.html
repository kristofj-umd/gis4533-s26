    Assignment 3: Adding GeoJSON to a Web Map

    In this assignment, you will add a GeoJSON of school attendance areas for Duluth to your web map. 
    You will also customize the styling and popups for the GeoJSON layer.

    Tasks:

    1. Download and simplify School Attendance Area Boundaries

    I downloaded this data from the MnGeoCommons. The source for the data is the Minnesota Department of Education. 
    The data has been filtered to the Duluth Public School District and re-projected to WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) 
    to make it compatible with our Leaflet map.
    In this step you will use Mapshaper to convert (and optimally simplify) the shapefile to GeoJSON format.

        - Download the data: https://github.com/kristofj-umd/webdev-unit/raw/master/duluth_school_attendance_areas.zip
        - Load the zipped shapefile into https://mapshaper.org/ (or your GIS software of choice)
        - Simplify the geometry. Play around with the simplification settings until you find one you like.
        - Export the data as a GeoJSON
            - Further simplify the data by specifying a coordinate precision in the export command line options
                 by typing in precision=0.001

    2. Add GeoJSON of Attendance Areas to the map
    Make sure to credit the source of the data by adding an attribution for it to the map.
        - Leaflet GeoJSON tutorial: https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/
        - GeoJSON reference: https://geojson.org/

    3. Update GeoJSON Styling
    Create a style function to customize the styling for your Attendance Areas.
        - To help distinguish the areas from one another consider using a random color generator. 
            - Lots of options are listed here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1484506/random-color-generator

    4. Add Popups to GeoJSON
    Add functionality so that when the user clicks on an attendance area, the schools for that area are listed in the popup.

    5. Add a Layout
    - Add some HTML and CSS to your web page to complement your map. 
    - At a minimum, this should include a title and subtitle for your map, but feel free to get creative and add some style!
    
    6. Finishing Up
        - In case it wasn't already obvious, you've created a thematic map. 
            That means you might need to update your basemap to something more plain and subdued (think figure-ground).
        - Also modify the map extent (so you can see all but the large northern attendance areas).
        - Make sure the code is organized and well commented so that someone else can understand what you did and how you did it.

    AI use: you can use AI as much as you like, but make sure to understand and verify the code it generates.
    I expect every block of code to have a comment above it describing what it does and how it works.
