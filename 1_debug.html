    Assignment 1: Find and Fix the Bugs
    This web map has 6 bugs in it. Your job is to find and fix them using the browser's Developer Tools.

    To open Developer Tools press F12, or right-click the page and select "Inspect".

    You will need to use:
        - The Console tab: shows JavaScript errors with line numbers and descriptions.
        - The Elements tab: shows the actual HTML structure of the page as the browser sees it. 
          You can also see the CSS styles applied to any element here.
        - (Optional) The Network tab: shows all files and resources the page tried to load.

    When the map is working correctly, you should see:
        1. A title ("A Working Web Map") and subtitle visible at the top of the page
        2. A map with a red border around it showing the the UMD campus
        3. A basemap using OpenStreetMap tiles (not a blank grey box)

    Tips:
        - Fix the bugs one at a time. After each fix, save the file, refresh the page, and check the console again.
        - Read the error messages carefully — they usually tell you exactly what's wrong and on which line.
        - If something looks wrong visually but there's no console error, try using the Elements tab to inspect the element.

    For each bug that you find and fix, leave a comment in the code describing:
        - What was the problem?
        - What tool helped you find it?
        - How did you fix it?
        
    AI use: you can ask questions of AI (such as "I'm getting this error (paste in error)" or "why isn't the title on this page showing up?") 
    Use it to make sense of and understand the code. But make the actual fixes yourself.
